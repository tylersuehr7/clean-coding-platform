# Clean Coding Platform

This project demonstrates building a sufficiently 'clean' client-server based platform.

It includes multiple types of systems development with an emphasis on 'clean-coding' and is intended to be used as a reference, template, or guideline for other projects. Consists of the following systems:

1. Backend: SQLite database
2. Backend: RESTful API (Django REST Framework – Python)
3. Frontend: Native iOS app (Swift)
4. Frontend: Native Android app (Kotlin)
5. Frontend: Flutter mobile app (Dart)
6. Frontend: VueJS web app (TypeScript)

Design patterns and coding techniques used within this project are based on my own subjective opinions of 'clean coding' and based on my own experience and learning from building software for many systems both low-level and high-level over the past 10 years. There's no one-size-fits-all architecture or solution for any system but perhaps this project can be adapted to fit most?

I'm always eager to learn more and adapt, so if you discover deficiencies with this architecture or have suggestions for improvements to make the code 'cleaner', please feel free to comment or create a pull request!
