# Clean Coding Platform â€“ "classified"

This directory is meant to contain sensitive information and secrets that are not meant to appear in the version control source code. It's represented here to show that it exists in the project but a production project would never have this directory in version control.

Add this entry into the `.gitignore` file:
- `classified/`
