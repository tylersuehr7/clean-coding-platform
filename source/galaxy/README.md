# Clean Coding Platform â€“ "galaxy"

This project is a RESTful API service in which the clients will interact with. This uses the Python Django REST

and its neat Django Admin UI console. Although the Spring Boot Framework would also have been a great production-ready 
choice alternatively.

# System requirements
- Python 3.9 (or later)
