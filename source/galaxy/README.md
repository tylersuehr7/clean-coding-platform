# Clean Coding Platform â€“ "galaxy"

This project is a RESTful API service in which the clients will interact with. 

This uses the Python Django REST Framework to implement its server-side behavior. This was chosen due to 
convenience, minimal development effort, and its neat Django Admin UI console. Although the Spring Boot 
Framework would also have been a great production-ready choice alternatively.
